- needs construct generator
- add starting resoures
- need to initalize resources
- maybe a difficulty setting (?)
- maybe more rng to promote replayablity
- create abstracts for resource 

Population (Resource)
- parent class 

    Idle (Population - Resource)
        - start with 10 
        - Contribute to defense 

    Farming (Population - Resource)
        - start with 0 can add from population 

    Culturing (Population - Resource) [need to change name]
        - start with 0 can add from population

Food 
- generated by the amount of ppl in Farming

Culture 
- generated by the amount of ppl in culturing 

Defense 
- generated by the amount of ppl in enlisted

Generators 
- generators can be upgraded(?) 2 main trains of going about this
- you can use culture to get a better rate
- i.e dropping 50 culture to get better cultivation practices to make more food
- culture gain would be a big number

- culture would be a skill point system (thinking about this train)
- x amt of culture would lead to a usuable skill point 
- culture would be hidden
- skill points would not be 
- not forced to spend skill points

Events 
- im thinking that we have 3 main events 
- rival civilization claims ur land 
    - have a random number generated of their warring population 
    - have their strength be based upon this
    - have another random number generated on their culture 
    - if strength is high = difficulty to defend
    - if culture is high = difficulty to trick
    - would basically be a skill check 
    - player would decide to fight, trick, or ignore
    - haven't thought of ignore 

- refugees come to ur land
    - increase population by x amount
    - decrease your culture by y amount
    - can refuse refugees with no negative consequences

- developing a trade partner (not concrete subject to change)
    - x civilization (random names go) wants to develop a trade relationship
    - 

- engineer a whole wonder of the world
    - way to "win" the game 
    - requirement have a high culture to build
    - game still goes on but now your civilization will be remembered
